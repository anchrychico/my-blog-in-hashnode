* **Research and Study Data Structures in TypeScript:**
    
    * Understand the commonly used data structures in TypeScript and how they are implemented.
        
    * Focus on how TypeScriptâ€™s strong typing system enhances the use of data structures.
        
* **Explain Each Data Structure in TypeScript:** For each data structure, provide the following details:
    
    * **Definition:** A brief explanation of the data structure.
        
    * **Key Features:** The important characteristics and behaviors of the data structure.
        
    * **Use Cases:** Where and why this data structure is typically used.
        
    * **Time Complexity:** Analyze the performance of each data structure (Big-O notation) for common operations like insert, delete, and search.
        
    * **Example Code in TypeScript:** Provide a TypeScript code snippet demonstrating how to use each data structure.
        
* **Data Structures to Cover:**
    

* ### **Arrays**:
    
* **Definition**: Arrays store multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. In TypeScript, arrays can be strongly typed to hold only specific types.
    
    * **Key Features**:
        
        Fixed or dynamic size.
        
        Zero-based indexing.
        
    * **Use Cases**: Storing a collection of items where order is important (e.g., product lists, user data).
        
    * **Time Complexity**:
        
        Access: O(1)
        
        Insertion (at the end): O(1)
        
        Deletion (at the end): O(1)
        
        Search: O(n)
        
* **TypeScript Code**:

* ## **Tuple:**
    
* **Definition**: Tuples are a special kind of array where the length and types of elements are fixed. Tuples can contain multiple data types.
    
* **Key Features**:
    
    * Fixed size.
        
    * Can store mixed data types.
        
* **Use Cases**: Returning multiple values from functions, structured data like coordinates or records.
    
* **Time Complexity**: Same as arrays.

        ## **Tree:**
        
        * **Definition**: A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right), and the left child contains nodes with values less than the parent node, while the right child contains nodes with values greater than the parent node.
            
        * **Key Features**:
            
            * Efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting nodes.

            * Deletion: O(log n)
                
            * Search: O(log n)
                
        * Worst case (unbalanced tree): O(n) for all operations.

        ## **Deliverables:**
        
        **Explanation**:
        
        * For **Set**, we covered its properties of uniqueness, and how to add, remove, and check for elements.
            
        * For **Binary Search Tree**, we discussed the sorted nature of the structure, and how it allows for efficient searching, insertion, and traversal.
            
        * **TypeScript Code Snippets**:
            
            * For **Set**, the code demonstrates creation, addition, removal, and checking for existence.
                
            * For **Binary Search Tree**, the code shows insertion, searching, and in-order traversal of nodes.
