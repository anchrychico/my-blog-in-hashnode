Did you know pysyduck is not a bird? Psyduck is not a flying type, because he isn't a bird (**he's a mammal - a platypus**).

they were renamed "Psyduck", **a combination of the words "psychic" and "duck"**. Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache, and usually just stands there vacantly, trying to calm its headache. When the headache gets too bad, its brain cells awaken, allowing it to use strong psychic powers.
